# Colors

Colors is a simple strategical game.
The game is a set of colored tiles. Every player has a corner as a start point (so there is a maximum of 4 players).
Tiles are owned, when they have the same color as the starting point of a player and are touching the tiles of that player.
The goal is to own as much tiles as possible by changing the color of the starting point (and all tiles owned by you).
